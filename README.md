# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

Our mission is to get the designers to create a habit-changing device, which helps the user form or get rid of a habit. Because we have a problem of bad handwriting, our group thought that a pencil that vibrates to alert user's poor handwriting would be a good fix the handwriting.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

The customers have a need to be more productive with work assignments (specifically job interview applications). They seem to be distracted by social media websites and internet websites, and by wasting time on them, they don't get work done.

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

1. We can create an application for your phone or computer that completely blocks access to the distracting websites that prohibit work. Because "these websites" will be dependent on the user and the situation, they will be chosen by the user, and can always be changed later. Although this change feature can be used to procrastinate and re enable access to blocked websites, which is a weakness, we have to assume that because the user has the app (and wants to get work done), they will use it properly. We will have an option to disable access to these sites during a specific time interval as well, if that make the user do more work.

1. Another option is to connect this "blocking" access to either the wifi, or a smart device, like the smart home. By locking them in a room, the user has no choice but to focus and get work done. Of course, there are emergency instances that our device can account for.

## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

1. Instead of an application, they thought a web extension would be more useful. In addition, they thought that people could cheat too easily by unchecking blocking boxes when the work is not actually complete or done well.

1. They did like the idea, but it could be a little extreme, especially in instances where there are roommates involved, or the workspace is located outside of the home.

(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

We might cater our application into more specific instances. For example, if an e-mail needs to be sent to someone specific, the application will check whether or not the email WAS actually sent. Likewise, if an essay needs to be completed, the app will run in the background checking words typed and quality of work.

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need for it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

1. Attraction: no one wants a clunky pencil.
1. Feasibility- do you expect it to work widespread?
1. Utility- is it practical?

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

The other group is happy, but says that even more improvement can be made 


***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***

The other group proposed a sleek finger sensor that would pick up handwriting via handwriting technique. While it was substantially different than what we envisioned, it is still feasible and contains utility. What I am still worried about is attraction to others. A finger sensor wouldn't seem cool to others.

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
- Things
- Services
- Feedback
- Human Actions
- Missions

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***
